Neural style transfer
# 🎨 Task 05 – Neural Style Transfer

This project demonstrates **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** — the process of applying the artistic style of one image (such as a famous painting) to the content of another image using deep learning techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To implement a simplified Neural Style Transfer pipeline using a pre-trained **VGG19** model in **PyTorch**, and apply the style of one image to another.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python (Google Colab)
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Pretrained VGG19 model
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Matplotlib

## 🔍 Process Overview

1. Installed required Python libraries (`torch`, `torchvision`, `PIL`, etc.)
2. Loaded a **content image** and a **style image** from public sources.
3. Preprocessed both images using torchvision transforms.
4. Used VGG19 features to simulate NST (simplified for demonstration).
5. Displayed and saved the stylized output.

## 🖼️ Sample Input & Output

- **Content Image:** A dancer or realistic photograph  
- **Style Image:** Picasso artwork or abstract painting  
- **Output:** Artistic rendering of the content image in the painting’s style

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- Understood how **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** extract content and style features
- Implemented a basic neural style transfer pipeline using PyTorch
- Practiced working with tensors and image transformations
- Explored how deep learning can be applied creatively in **computer vision and art**
